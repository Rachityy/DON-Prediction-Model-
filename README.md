This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts DON (mycotoxin) concentration in grains using spectral reflectance data. The model is built using MLPRegressor (Neural Network) and FastAPI for real-time predictions.

Features Preprocessing: Handles missing values, log transformation, and feature scaling.
Machine Learning Model: Uses a Neural Network (MLPRegressor) to predict DON levels.
SHAP Analysis: Explains feature importance for model transparency.
API Deployment: The model is wrapped in a FastAPI-based API for real-time predictions.
